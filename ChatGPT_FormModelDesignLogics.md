## You

I have a Angular application and express backend api which acts as a calculation engine. The angular application renders form and api takes data from the form for calculations.

I want to acheive independence in maintaining model of the form. How can I acheive that?

You can achieve independence in maintaining the model of the form by creating a separate service in your Angular application that handles all the form data and communicates with the backend API.

Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Create a new service in your Angular application using the `ng generate service` command.

2. In this service, define a model for the form data and create methods to get and set the data.

3. Modify your form component to use this service instead of managing the form data itself.

4. When the user submits the form, call a method in the service to send the data to the backend API for calculations.

5. The backend API should return the calculated results, which can be displayed in the Angular application.

By following these steps, you can ensure that any changes to the form model can be easily managed in the service, without affecting the rest of the application. This also makes it easier to maintain and test your code.
