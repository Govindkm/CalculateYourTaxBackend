I used npm init and it is asking for entry point, what is that?

ChatGPT
-------

When you run `npm init` command in your Node.js project, it will prompt you for some information about your package such as the name, version, description, author and so on. One of the prompts will ask for an entry point.

The entry point is simply the main file of your Node.js application. It is the file that will be executed when someone runs your application or imports your module.

For example, if you are creating a backend service using Node.js, your entry point might be named `server.js`, `app.js`, or `index.js`. This file will typically contain your server setup code, database connection, middleware configuration and route handling logic.

So, to specify the entry point, you simply need to enter the file name that contains the main code for your application when prompted during `npm init` and press enter.
