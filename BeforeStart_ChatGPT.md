For creating a backend service that performs tax calculations and validations while also being scalable and flexible for changes in tax laws, you could use Node.js as your backend tool.

Node.js is known for its ability to handle heavy I/O operations, making it perfect for building scalable and efficient backend services. It also has a rich library of packages and modules available through NPM, which can be used to streamline development and add functionality.

In terms of accurately calculating taxes, you could leverage pre-built taxation calculation libraries such as `Taxee.io`, `Avalara`, `Vertex` or `TaxJar`. These can help provide precise calculations based on the latest tax laws.

As for exporting PDF summaries of the tax calculations, there are multiple npm packages such as `pdfkit`, `html-pdf` which would enable you to generate the PDF reports and email them to the users.

Overall, Node.js would be a great choice for your backend service for tax application due to its scalability, flexibility, extensive libraries and support for third-party packages.
