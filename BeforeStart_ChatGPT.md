## You

I have an UI Application for tax calculations which will be sending me user income and deductions details and based on different indan laws for income I have to calculate the taxes.

The taxes should be accurate and reliable.

What backend technology I can use in this case?

## Genie

There are many backend technologies that you can use to build a reliable and accurate tax calculation system. Here are a few suggestions:
 
1. **Python:** Python is a popular choice for building web applications, including those for tax calculations. It has an extensive library support, including libraries for financial calculations, such as NumPy and Pandas.

2. **Node.js:** Node.js is another great option for building tax calculation systems. It is known for its speedy and efficient handling of I/O operations, which is important when dealing with large amounts of data.

3. **Java:** Java is a widely used programming language in the enterprise world that can handle complex calculations efficiently. The Spring framework can be used for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.

Ultimately, the choice of technology depends on your specific requirements, experience and familiarity with the language, and the size and complexity of your application.

I have a good knowledge of Javascript but not nodejs.

If you have good knowledge of Javascript but not Node.js, you can still use Node.js as your backend technology. Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine and allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. 

Node.js has a large and active community which provides many modules that can help you with building your tax calculation application. You can use Express.js which is a popular Node.js web framework for building web applications. For database integration, you can use MongoDB which is a NoSQL document-based database that can store data in JSON-like documents.

You can also consider using AWS Lambda for serverless computing where you do not have to worry about managing servers or infrastructure. AWS Lambda allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. This approach can save time and costs for your tax calculation application.

Overall, I recommend you learn Node.js as it can be a great backend technology for your tax calculation application, and having knowledge of both JavaScript and Node.js will also be beneficial for your career growth as a developer.

## You

What tools can I use in nodejs. The backend will act as calculation engine only and does not connect to any external service or database. It has to process the inputs sent by UI in the form user filled form.

## Genie

Node.js allows you to use JavaScript on the server-side. You can use it along with any suitable backend framework like Express.js, Koa.js, Hapi.js etc. Following are some tools which can be used in nodejs for building your backend:

1. Express.js: Express.js is a widely-used and popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides features such as middleware support, routing, templating engines and more.

2. body-parser: body-parser is a middleware that parses incoming request bodies before your handlers, and makes it available under req.body property. This will be helpful in parsing the user input from the form.

3. nodemon: nodemon is a utility tool that watches for file changes in the Node.js application and automatically restarts the server when there are any changes. This helps in development making it easy to see the effect of code changes immediately.

4. Joi: Joi is a robust validation library for Node.js, used to validate user inputs or data before processing it, thus preventing errors and providing a better user experience while using the application.

5. Mocha, Chai and Sinon: These are testing frameworks for Node.js. They make it easy to write automated tests for your APIs and ensure accuracy and reliability of your tax calculations

You can install these modules via npm (Node Package Manager) which is integrated with node.js installation.
