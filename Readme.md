# Express API Service

This is an Express API service running on port 3000 by default.

## How to Use

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required to run this service:

- `PORT`: The port number that the service will listen on.
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment type for the server to run application in production or debugging modes
- `LOG_PATG`: Logpath to store logs generated by the service.
- `OPEN_API_KEY`: Your own open API key to chat with OPENAI GPT
- `VECTORS_DIRECTORY`: Directory path to save your embedding vectors once created.

You can set these variables in a `.env` file at the root of the project. Here's an example:

```
NODE_ENV=DEVELOPMENT
LOG_PATH=logs
PORT=3000
OPEN_API_KEY="add your key here"
VECTORS_DIRECTORY=data

```

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Govindkm/CalculateYourTaxBackend.git

2. Install dependencies:

3. Set environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and set the required environment variables (see above).
