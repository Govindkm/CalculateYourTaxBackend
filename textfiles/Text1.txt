Further, his/her employer has deposited Rs 1.5 lakh in his/her Tier-I NPS account. This makes him eligible to claim deduction under section 80CCD(2) of the Income-tax Act. Calculating net taxable income under new tax regime

Particulars Amount (In Rs)

Gross total income 20,00,000

Deduction under section 80CCD (2) 1,50,000

Net taxable income 18,50,000

Hence, the net taxable income on which income tax payable is to be calculated will be Rs 18.50 lakh (Rs 20 lakh minus Rs 1.5 lakh). Under the new income tax regime, income up to Rs 2,50,000 is exempted from tax. Hence, no tax will be payable on this income. Post this, the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 16,00,000 (Rs 18,50,000 minus Rs 2,50,000).The next slab is between Rs 2.5 lakh and up to Rs 5 lakh. Thus, out of Rs 16,00,000, Rs 2.5 lakh (Rs 5 lakh minus Rs 2.5 lakh) will be taxed at 5%. The tax payable here will be Rs 12,500. Post this, the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 13,50,000 (Rs 16,00,000 minus Rs 2,50,000). The next slab is between Rs 5 lakh and up to Rs 7.5 lakh. Out of Rs 13,50,000, the next Rs 2.5 lakh (Rs 7.5 lakh minus Rs 5 lakh) will be taxed at 10%. The income tax payable comes out to be Rs 25,000.The balance income left is Rs 11,00,000 (Rs 13,50,000 minus Rs 2,50,000). The next slab under the income tax regime is between Rs 7.5 lakh and up to Rs 10 lakh. Hence, out of Rs 11,00,000, the Rs 2.5 lakh (Rs 10 lakh minus Rs 7.5 lakh) will be taxed at 15%. The tax payable amount will be Rs 37,500.The balance income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 8,50,000 (Rs 11,00,000 minus Rs 2.5 lakh). The next slab is between Rs 10 lakh and up to Rs 12,50,000. Out of Rs 8,50,000, the next Rs 2,50,000 will be taxed at Rs 20%. The tax payable amount will be Rs 50,000. The balance income left that is still chargeable to Rs tax is Rs 6,00,000 (Rs 8,50,000 minus Rs 2,50,000). The next slab is between Rs 12,50,000 and Rs 15,00,000). Out of Rs 6,00,000, the next Rs 2,50,000 (Rs 15,00,000 minus Rs 12,50,000) will be taxed at 25%. The tax payable amount will be Rs 62,500. Now the balance income which is left is Rs 3,50,000 (Rs 6,00,000 minus Rs 2,50,000). This will be taxed as per the last slab, i.e., above Rs 15,00,000 at 30% tax rate. The tax payable amount will be Rs 1,05,000. Calculation of income tax payable for taxable income of Rs 18.50 lakh

How to calculate income tax liability under old tax regime If you have decided to opt for the old tax regime for the current financial year, then it is important to know which income tax slab your income falls under. The slab rate applicable to your income will determine the tax rate at which the last rupee of your income will be taxed at. Under the old income tax regime, an individual taxpayer can claim various deductions and tax exemptions to bring down their gross total income. Once eligible tax exemptions and deductions are deducted from the gross total income, then you will arrive at net taxable income. It is on this income, an individual will calculate tax payable.Here is an example on how to calculate income tax payable under the old tax regime.Suppose an individual aged below 60 years has a gross total income of Rs 17 lakh for the current financial year, i.e., FY 2022-23. An individual has decided to opt for the old tax regime for the current financial year. Further, he/she is eligible to claim following tax exemption and deductions - section 80C for up to Rs 1.5 lakh, section 80CCD(1b) for NPS investment of Rs 50,000, section 80D of Rs 25,000 for medical insurance premium paid and section 80TTA of Rs 10,000 on savings account interest earned.

Section 80TTA (10,000)

Net taxable income 14,65,000

After deducting the deductions from the gross total income, one arrives at the net taxable income of Rs 14,65,000. The tax payable will be calculated on the net taxable income.As per the income tax slab rates table, the first Rs 2.5 lakh from net taxable income will be exempted from tax. This is because there is no tax on income up to Rs 2.5 lakh as per current income tax slabs. Post this, income left on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 12,15,000 (14,65,000-2,50,000). The second slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh which is taxed at Rs 5%. This means that out of Rs 12,15,000, then next Rs 2,50,000 will be taxed at 5%. The tax amount will be Rs 12,500.Now the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 9,65,000. The third slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, taxed at 20%. This means that out Rs 9,65,000, Rs 5,00,000 will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable here will be Rs 1,00,000.The balance income on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 4,65,000. The tax amount on this balance income (Rs 14,65,000 minus Rs 10,00,000) will be calculated on the basis of the last slab, i.e., above Rs 10 lakh at the rate of 30%. The tax payable amount comes out to be Rs 1,39,500.Hence, the total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,52,000 (Rs 12,500 + 1,00,000+ 1,39,500).

The final tax amount payable by individual is Rs 2,62,080.

How to know which income tax slab you fall in To calculate the income tax payable in a particular financial year, one needs to know the tax slabs their income falls in. Also, it will also depend on the income tax regime chosen by him/her in a particular financial year. An individual will compare the income tax payable in both the tax regimes before choosing the one.To know the income tax slabs and rates applicable to your income, one must first know the taxable income on which tax has to be calculated. If an individual continues with old, existing income tax regime, then he/she is eligible to claim tax exemption (such as House Rent Allowance exemption, Leave Travel Allowance exemption, standard deduction) and deductions under sections 80C to 80U, as eligible for. After claiming and deducting the tax exemptions and deductions that an individual is eligible for, he/she arrives at the taxable income on which income tax payable is calculated. For example, your total income from all sources is Rs 12 lakh. You are eligible to claim deduction of Rs 2.10 lakh under sections 80C, 80TTA, 80CCD(1b). The taxable income on which you have to calculate tax will be Rs 9.9 lakh (Rs 12 lakh - Rs 2.10 lakh). Your income tax slab in the old tax regime will be between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. The tax rate is the 20%.However, if he/she opts for a new, concessional tax regime, then one cannot claim the tax exemption and deductions mentioned above. From the example above, the taxable income will be Rs 12 lakh on which tax payable will be calculated. Under the new tax regime, an individual's income falls under the slab of Rs 10,00,001 and Rs 12,50,000. The tax rate here also is 20%.

Surcharge on income tax If an individual's net taxable income exceeds a specified level, then a surcharge is levied. The surcharge is levied on the income tax payable amount before the levy of cess. According to income tax laws, a surcharge is applicable if an individual's taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.In Budget 2023, the government announced multiple surcharge rates under the new tax regime. The new surcharge rates will be applicable from FY 2023-24 and come into effect from April 1, 2023. Surcharge rate from April 1, 2023 under new tax regime

Income range Surcharge rate

Up to Rs 50 lakh Nil

More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore 10%

More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore 15%

More than Rs 2 crore 25%

However, individuals opting for the old tax regime in FY 2023-24 will continue to pay the surcharge rate they were paying in the previous financial years. Surcharge rate under old tax regime

Income range Surcharge rate

Upto Rs 50 lakh Nil

More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore 10%

More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore 15%

More than Rs 2 crore but up to Rs 5 crore 25%

More than Rs 5 crore 37%

There are certain exceptions to the surcharge rates mentioned above. If an individual has earned income from capital gains (short term or long term) through the sale of equity shares and equity mutual funds or dividend income, the surcharge will not exceed 15%, irrespective of the income range. While understanding the concept of surcharge, one must also know the term marginal relief. The concept of marginal relief kicks in when the amount of surcharge on income tax payable exceeds the increase in income over the specified limit.Suppose an individual has a net taxable income of Rs 51,00,000. As the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh, the surcharge will be applicable at the rate of 10%. The tax payable on Rs 51,00,000 (without surcharge) is Rs 13,42,500. The surcharge amount will be Rs 1,34,250.Here the surcharge amount (Rs 1,34,250) is higher than the additional income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1,00,000). This is where the concept of marginal relief kicks in.To know the amount of marginal relief that is applicable, one needs to calculate income tax payable on Rs 50 lakh. This is because no surcharge will be applicable till the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. The income tax payable will be Rs 13,12,500. Now add income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1 lakh) to the income tax payable amount. The tax payable amount under marginal relief will be Rs 14,12,500.To ascertain the actual income tax payable with surcharge, compare the normal tax liability (before surcharge and cess) and tax liability after marginal tax relief (without cess). Normal tax liability is Rs 13,42,500 and tax liability after marginal tax relief is Rs 14,12,500. The surcharge that will be applicable is Rs 70,000 (Rs 14,12,500 - Rs 13,42,500).The final tax payable amount will be Rs 13,42, 500 (Tax payable amount) + Rs 70,000 (Surcharge) + Rs 56,500 (Cess at 4% on Rs 14,12,500) = Rs 14,69,000.

The new tax regime does not allow 70 deductions and exemptions (discussed in para 4). 

The tax payable under both the new and the old regimes without claiming deductions and exemptions for FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24) is as below:

Annual income^	Tax under the old regime (Rs)	Tax under the new regime (Rs)	Tax savings under the new regime (Rs)

Up to Rs 15,00,000	273,000	195,000	78,000
^ Assuming same annual income as base for both regimes which is usually is not the case, since standard deduction and many more deductions/exemptions would not be allowed for new tax regime.

Can I choose between the new tax regime and the existing regime?

A salaried taxpayer can choose the new tax regime at the beginning of FY 2023-24 and intimate their employer. The employee cannot change their choice anytime during the financial year. However, they can change their choice when filing the income tax return in July 2024.
The due date for tax filing for the FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24) is 31st July 2023.
In case an employee does not choose the new tax regime at the beginning of the financial year, the employer will deduct tax (TDS) under the existing tax regime. A salaried taxpayer can choose the new tax regime in one year and choose the regular tax regime in another year.
A non-salaried taxpayer has to choose the new regime when filing the tax return. They need not declare or intimate their choice to anyone during the year. However, a non-salaried taxpayer (taxpayers with an income from business or profession) cannot opt-in and opt-out of the new tax regime every year. Once a non-salaried opts out of the new tax regime, they cannot opt-in again for the new tax regime in the future.
