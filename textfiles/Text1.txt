Title: [Alpha Beta] OTP | Integration - OIT | Return Worksheet | Error Encountered
Schema: AlphaT900
Change Request Id: CHG123231 - cppads08

Description:
User is attempting to transfer data into Tax Prov - Return Dataset using Enhanced Integration (OIT > OTP). When in the Return Worksheet, he is able to select the options in the drop-down menu; however, when he clicks on Retrieve Data he then receives an "ERROR: Error encountered" message

The following has been confirmed: 
The Years agree in all systems - Dataset Year, Map/Mapset Year, Binder Year. 
The Binder ID is correctly set up in OIT. 
The Return Dataset has properly established the Dataset Relations.

Resolution Details:
The issue was happening because for the year 2021, there was no Parent Binder assigned.
Under OIT, once an entity is set as parent binder the issue is resolved and the client was able to retrieve the data from OIT into OTP.

User ID testuser is now working for new company: testcompany   DBID: C4  , when user logs in, she sees the correct company name in OneSource , but when she clicks on Tax Provision tile, she gets access to her old company: FormerCompany DBID: 1A Tax Provision instance (ID: 14452122) and she´s able to see the datasets from old company.
We confirmed she was setup on her new company using the same login ID she had on her old company keeladuncan   , old company deleted her account from OneSource but she´s still showing access in Tax Provision Administration (we removed access immediately). I advised user to request new account be created for her with different login ID on her new company and delete current ID testuser to avoid further issues.
